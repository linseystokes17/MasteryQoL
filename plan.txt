Datasets of interest:
 - health_related_qol (main)
 - population_by_zip_2000/2010

TODO
 - create an ERD to help in figuring out 3NF

 Cleaning:
 - health_related_qol (convert to 3NF)
 

Decisions:
 - Need to decide how I want to categorize data (State, Zip, etc)
 - My ideas are very broad - I need to cut down and focus on a couple of variables
    - I like religion and mental health factors, maybe physical
